The cows

The cows were named Kitchen and ??? Geoff and Jonathan C tried to ride the calf.

Guavas

We used to pick guavas off the trees in the orchard - they were freely available and much appreciated!

The bogey

I found a bogey in the factory. It came from one of the cane trolleys, and I decided to take it back to Chiltley to use as a barbell. I figured it would be an easy task to roll it all the way home on the railroad track which ran from the factory in Paddock all the way past Chiltley at a gentle incline. I placed it on the rails at the road crossing and started pushing it. I had to keep stopping it from running ahead because of the incline, but this became tedious after a while, so I thought I might run ahead of it and catch it further down the track.
