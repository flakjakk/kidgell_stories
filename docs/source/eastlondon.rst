The Tuck Shop

My favourite was the sausage roll. This came in two sizes, a 6c and an 11c version. Smothered in tomato sauce! Yummy...

The School Orchestra

I played trumpet in the school orchestra which was lead by Mr. Ian Sampson. On band days I had to lug my trumpet with me on the bus to school and back. One day I left it on the bus when I got off near home and never twigged until I got on the bus the next day and the bus driver gave it back to me. Whew!

Mr. Sampson thought I might go further so set up an audition for me with the East London Youth Orchestra, but we were leaving for Johannesburg so I never got to try out.
